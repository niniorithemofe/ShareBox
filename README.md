# ShareBox
The Share Box system follows a modular and microservice architecture. The system is divided into three main components: the hardware layer, the software layer, and the communication layer. The Hardware Layer consists of the electronic locking mechanism controlled by a WiFi-enabled ESP microcontroller. It follows a Sensor-Signal-System design, where sensors detect interaction, signals are processed by the ESP, and the system responds with appropriate locking or unlocking actions. The Software Layer is Built using a microservice architecture, this layer is composed of several independent components: A user-friendly interface for administrators, receivers and donors.A machine learning model API responsible for verifying the quality and condition of donations.A Flask integration module that serves as the bridge between the front-end interface and the backend machine learning services.Lastly Firebase is used as the central backend service for: User Authentication, Realtime Database and Cloud Storage. The communication layer manages data exchange between the software and hardware components using RESTful APIs and MQTT protocols to ensure real-time synchronization, low-latency control, and secure communication. The communication layer facilitates seamless communication across multiple all relevant components This architecture allows for scalability, modular reuse, independent updates, and  user-friendly experience across all app functionalities.
